# DocPlotTest

Documentation for [DocPlotTest](https://github.com/tp2750/DocPlotTest.jl).

```@index
```

## Purpose

This repo is to test documentation including plots, as I have had problems getting that to work.

Step one is making documentation work with not plots.



```@autodocs
Modules = [DocPlotTest]
```
